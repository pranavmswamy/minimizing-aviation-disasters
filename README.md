A majority of civil aviation disasters over the past few decades (58%) has been attributed to ‘Pilot Error’ - a phrase generally used to describe wrong decisions, actions or even inaction by a pilot of an airplane, which is determined to be a major contributing factor in accidents involving the deaths of many passengers. It includes lapses in judgment due to fatigue, extreme habits, oversights and failure to follow correct protocol. This paper demonstrates how we can use pilots’ real-time physiological metrics to determine and predict their various cognitive states, thereby developing a model that can be installed in warning systems to ensure they are fully focused on to the task at hand.
